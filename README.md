This repository contains samples for the SentryOne Task Factory product.

## REST Configuration Files 
We've included [sample configuration files](/rest/configs/) for use with the REST Source and Destination. 
These make it easier to connect 
to certain REST APIs by providing the endpoints in a predefined file. To use them, copy the desired configuration file
to the following location: `[InstallDir]\OAuth2ConfigFiles`. Typically the InstallDir is 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Pragmatic Works\Task Factory`.
